IMPORTANT: Any characters implemented here is implemented WRONG

They have incomplete steps, missing traces, level and eidolons check,...
They are not even implemented consistently, or have correct numbers.

This folder is used as a reference for API structuring.

Note that I didn't care about multiple allocation nor optimization, the more important feedback is how comfortable you feel implement things.
